      Construction of the backbone of Pylon is underway. The resource miners are now on the planet, generating Pylons.
      Pylon will soon be able to bootstrap its design team from payments with its mining equipment.
      For the next few months that design team will likely be Tyler and some remote workers.

      All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a
      smoothly running sentence or as an assembly of lines, which may even have
      contrasting shapes. Good typog- raphy begins, and this is no minor
      matter, with the typeset- ting of a single line of text in a book or a
      newspaper. Using exactly the same typeface, it is possible to create either
      a pleasant line, easily read, or an onerous one. Spacing, if it is too wide
      or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.
