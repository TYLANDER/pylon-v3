      Pylon – a distributed design studio.

    <p class="measure-wide">
      A progressive digital design and development studio. Pylon is the first studio to accecpt cryptocurrency for client work.
      It is adopted by many countries around the world
      and is based on the German DIN metric Standards. The United States uses
      a basic letter size (8 1/2 x 11”) of ugly proportions, and results in
      complete chaos with an endless amount of paper sizes. It is a
      by-product of the culture of free enterprise, competition and waste.
      Just another example of the misinterpretations of freedom.
